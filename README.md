Continuation to the JS Task 01, I should be able to add new product as well now. When you select the category from the First Page, click on Add Product Button it should open a blank form with all the required form fields. Use the DevXtreme Form to design the forms (Link above). Saving is not required, but all the validations should be there.
Selected category should be already selected in the opened new form page.
